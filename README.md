Utilized the OpenAI API to generate quizzes on any topic provided to it.

Implemented a seamless flow: user inputs data on the frontend, which is then sent to the backend.

The backend processes the data and returns it to the frontend, presenting it as a visually appealing quiz.

Achieved an attractive and user-friendly UI design with media queries for the quiz interface.
